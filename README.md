Linear Regression to find relationships between sleep and an active lifestyle

**Objective 1:**
Understanding Sleep Patterns: The primary objective of conducting a linear regression analysis on Fitbit data is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between sleep activity and various physical and lifestyle factors. By exploring how sleep quality (dependent variable) is influenced by independent variables such as Activity Score, Total Steps, Total Distance, Calories, and Average Intensity, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform individuals about the impact of their daily activities on their sleep. This analysis will enable us to quantitatively assess which factors contribute positively or negatively to sleep quality and identify areas for potential improvement.

**Objective 2:**
Predictive Modeling and Health Optimization: Another key objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast sleep activity based on the selected independent variables. This predictive capability will empower individuals to proactively manage their sleep patterns by adjusting their physical activity levels, caloric intake, and other lifestyle factors. The model can serve as a valuable tool for making data-driven decisions to optimize sleep quality and overall health. Ultimately, the goal is to provide actionable insights and personalized recommendations that promote better sleep habits, leading to improved well-being and quality of life. Through this analysis, we aim to bridge the gap between lifestyle choices and sleep outcomes, offering individuals a data-driven approach to achieving healthier and more restful sleep patterns.

**Stakeholders:**
Fitbit users, the primary stakeholders, can use analysis insights to optimize their health by adjusting daily routines. Healthcare professionals and wellness coaches are secondary stakeholders who can provide data-driven guidance to patients and clients for improved sleep and physical activity, enhancing overall well-being.
